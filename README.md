# Sentiment Analysis

In this project you can find an exploration of sentiment analysis concepts and libraries.

It was developed as a small project for my Data Science Program.

I would like to thank Marius Mogyorosi for the marvelous article in https://realpython.com/python-nltk-sentiment-analysis/#training-and-using-a-classifier
It helped me a great deal in conceptualizing what exactly I needed to make different classifiers work
